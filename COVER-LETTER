Note that poll on a new syscal is better than ioctl because you can parallely block.

TODO:
- kselftests
- test for resource leaks, stress test
- add warnings like Andy did
- move pidfd_send_signal to pidfd.c
- can execve cause exits on the main thread? - Daniel provided some information
  on the case.
- a pid can point to multiple task_struct, how does this work?
- EXIT_TRACE code needs special handling?
- don't hold onto task_struct, takes memory
- make what to block on as a separate pidfd_wait param.
- task can be converted to pid using task->thread_pid.
