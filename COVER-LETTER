These patches clean up the usage of dynticks nesting counters simplifying the
code, while preserving the usecases.

It is a much needed simplification, makes the code less confusing, and prevents
future bugs such as those that arise from forgetting that the
dynticks_nmi_nesting counter is not a simple counter and can be "crowbarred" in
common situations.

Several nights of rcutorture testing with CONFIG_RCU_EQS_DEBUG on all RCU
kernel configurations have survived without any splats.

Further testing is in progress, hence marked as RFC!

thanks,
