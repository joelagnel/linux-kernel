Hi,

This is a series on top of the patch "rcu/tree: Add basic support for kfree_rcu() batching".

Link: http://lore.kernel.org/r/20190814160411.58591-1-joel@joelfernandes.org

It adds performance tests, some clean ups and removal of "lazy" RCU callbacks.

Now that kfree_rcu() is handled separately from call_rcu(), we also get rid of
kfree "lazy" handling from tree RCU as suggested by Paul which will be unused.
This also results in a nice negative delta as well.

option-subject kfree_rcu() additions for -rcu
