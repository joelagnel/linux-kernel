These patches fix various sparse errors found as a result of the recent check
to add rcu_check_sparse() to rcu_assign_pointer().  The errors in some cases
seem to either missing API usage, or missing annotations. The annotations added
in the series can also help avoid future incorrect usages and bugs so it is a
good idea to do in any case.
