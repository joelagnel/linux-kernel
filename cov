option-prefix PATCH v5 -rcu
option-subject Maintain the length of each segment in the segcblist

This is required for several usecases identified. One of them being tracing how
the segmented callback list changes. Tracing this has identified issues in RCU
code in the past.

From Paul:
Another use case is of course more accurately
determining whether a given CPU's large pile of callbacks can be best
served by making grace periods go faster, invoking callbacks more
vigorously, or both.  It should also be possible to simplify some of
the callback handling a bit, given that some of the unnatural acts are
due to there having been no per-batch counts.

Passes 30 minutes of TREE01, TREE03, TREE07.  Testing of other TREE configs is
in progress.

Patches are based on -rcu commit:
4f43de2a419a ("Merge branch 'lkmm-dev.2020.08.24a' into HEAD")

Revision history:
v5: ?

v4: Restructured rcu_do_batch() and segcblist merging to avoid issues.
    Fixed minor nit from Davidlohr.
v1->v3: minor nits.
