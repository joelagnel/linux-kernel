These patches clean up the usage of dynticks nesting counters simplifying the
code, while preserving the usecases.

It is a much needed simplification, makes the code less confusing, and prevents
future bugs such as those that arise from forgetting that the
dynticks_nmi_nesting counter is not a simple counter and can be "crowbarred" in
common situations.

rcutorture testing with all TREE RCU configurations succeed with
CONFIG_RCU_EQS_DEBUG=y and CONFIG_PROVE_LOCKING=y.

v1->v2:
- Rebase on v5.6-rc6
