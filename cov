Hello,

Just sending a few patches before lazy rcu v6 can come out. That can come out
after more testing to check feasibility of ideas discussed at LPC. I will try
to get rcutop pushed as well before that, but in the meanwhile I don't see much
reason to block these few patches for 6.1. These apply to Paul's rcu/next
branch. What do you think?

option-prefix PATCH rcu/next
option-subject Preparatory patches borrowed from lazy rcu v5
