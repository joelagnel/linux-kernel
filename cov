Just a refresh of v3 with one additional debug patch. v3's cover letter is here:
 https://lore.kernel.org/all/20220713213237.1596225-1-joel@joelfernandes.org/

I just started working on this again while I have some time during paternity
leave ;-) So I thought I'll just send it out again. No other changes other
than that 1 debug patch I added on the top.

Next I am going to go refine the power results as mentioned in Paul's comments
on the last cover letter.

====
add this:
Here is another big selling point for call_rcu_lazy().
Instead of _lazy(), if you just increased jiffies_till_first_fqs, and
slowed *all* call_rcu() down to achieve the same effect, that would
affect percpu refcounters switching to atomic-mode, for example.

They switch to atomic mode by calling __percpu_ref_switch_mode() which
is called by percpu_ref_switch_to_atomic_sync().

This will slow this call down for the full lazy duration which will slow
down suspend in blk_pre_runtime_suspend().

This is why, we cannot assume call_rcu() users will mostly just want to
free memory. There could be cases just like this, and just blanket slow
down of call_rcu() might bite at unexpected times.
