Hi,

This is a series on top of the patch "rcu/tree: Add basic support for kfree_rcu() batching".

It adds performance tests, some clean ups and removal of "lazy" RCU callbacks.

Now that kfree_rcu() is handled separately from call_rcu(), we also get rid of
kfree "lazy" handling from tree RCU as suggested by Paul which will be unused.

Based on patch:
