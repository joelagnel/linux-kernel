v7 version of RCU lazy patches based on rcu/next branch.

To facilitate easier merge, I dropped tracing and other patches and just
implemented the new changes. I will post the tracing patches later along with
rcutop as I need to add new tracepoints that Frederic suggested.

Main recent changes:
1. rcu_barrier() wake up only for lazy bypass list.
2. Make all call_rcu() default-lazy and add call_rcu_flush() API.
3. Take care of some callers using call_rcu_flush() API.
4. Several refactorings suggested by Paul/Frederic.
5. New call_rcu() to call_rcu_flush() conversions by Joel/Vlad/Paul.

I am seeing good performance and power with these patches on real ChromeOS x86
asymmetric hardware.

List of recent changes:
    
    [ Frederic Weisbec: Program the lazy timer only if WAKE_NOT, since other
      deferral levels wake much earlier so for those it is not needed. ]
    
    [ Frederic Weisbec: Use flush flags to keep bypass API code clean. ]
    
    [ Frederic Weisbec: Make rcu_barrier() wake up only if main list empty. ]
    
    [ Frederic Weisbec: Remove extra 'else if' branch in rcu_nocb_try_bypass(). ]
    
    [ Joel: Fix issue where I was not resetting lazy_len after moving it to rdp ]
    
    [ Paul/Thomas/Joel: Make call_rcu() default lazy so users don't mess up. ]
    
    [ Paul/Frederic : Cosmetic changes, split out wakeup of nocb thread. ]
    
    [ Vlad/Joel : More call_rcu -> flush conversions ]
