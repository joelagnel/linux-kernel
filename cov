Hello,
These patches improve kfree_rcu() to support:
- kfree_rcu() headless usage.
- both vmalloc() and slab free'ing support using array of pointers.
- simpler debugobjects handling.

It applies on rcu/dev branch as of March 29th.

Testing with rcuperf shows following changes. The memory footprint reduces and
batches go slightly up. This is assumed an acceptable change.

with all patches:
Total time taken by all kfree'ers: 27312964461 ns, loops: 20000, batches: 3120, memory footprint: 211MB
Total time taken by all kfree'ers: 26773272309 ns, loops: 20000, batches: 3084, memory footprint: 208M

without:
Total time taken by all kfree'ers: 25711621811 ns, loops: 20000, batches: 2814, memory footprint: 230MB          
 Total time taken by all kfree'ers: 25775800546 ns, loops: 20000, batches: 2755, memory footprint: 230MB
