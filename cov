Core-Scheduling
===============
Enclosed is series v9 of core scheduling.
v9 is rebased on tip/master (fe4adf6f92c4 ("Merge branch 'irq/core'"))..
I hope that this version is acceptable to be merged (pending any new review
comments that arise) as the main issues in the past are all resolved:
 1. Vruntime comparison.
 2. Documentation updates.
 3. CGroup and per-task interface developed by Google and Oracle.
 4. Hotplug fixes.
Almost all patches also have Reviewed-by or Acked-by tag. See below for full
list of changes in v9.

Introduction of feature
=======================
Core scheduling is a feature that allows only trusted tasks to run
concurrently on cpus sharing compute resources (eg: hyperthreads on a
core). The goal is to mitigate the core-level side-channel attacks
without requiring to disable SMT (which has a significant impact on
performance in some situations). Core scheduling (as of v7) mitigates
user-space to user-space attacks and user to kernel attack when one of
the siblings enters the kernel via interrupts or system call.

By default, the feature doesn't change any of the current scheduler
behavior. The user decides which tasks can run simultaneously on the
same core (for now by having them in the same tagged cgroup). When a tag
is enabled in a cgroup and a task from that cgroup is running on a
hardware thread, the scheduler ensures that only idle or trusted tasks
run on the other sibling(s). Besides security concerns, this feature can
also be beneficial for RT and performance applications where we want to
control how tasks make use of SMT dynamically.

Both a CGroup and Per-task interface via prctl(2) are provided for configuring
core sharing. More details are provided in documentation patch.  Kselftests are
provided to verify the correctness/rules of the interface.

Testing
=======
ChromeOS testing shows 300% improvement in keypress latency on a Google
docs key press with Google hangout test (the maximum latency drops from 150ms
to 50ms for keypresses).

Julien: TPCC tests showed improvements with core-scheduling as below. With kernel
protection enabled, it does not show any regression. Possibly ASI will improve
the performance for those who choose kernel protection (can be toggled through
sched_core_protect_kernel sysctl).
				average		stdev		diff
baseline (SMT on)		1197.272	44.78312824	
core sched (   kernel protect)	412.9895	45.42734343	-65.51%
core sched (no kernel protect)	686.6515	71.77756931	-42.65%
nosmt				408.667		39.39042872	-65.87%
(Note these results are from v8).

Vineeth tested sysbench and does not see any regressions.
Hong and Aubrey tested v9 and see results similar to v8. There is a known issue
with uperf that does regress. This appears to be because of ksoftirq heavily
contending with other tasks on the core. The consensus is this can be improved
in the future.

Other changes:
- Fixed breaking of coresched= option patch on !SCHED_CORE builds.
- Trivial commit message changes.

Changes in v10
==============
- migration code changes from Aubrey.
- dropped patches merged.
- interface changes from Josh and Chris.

Changes in v9
=============
- Note that the vruntime snapshot change is written in 2 patches to show the
  progression of the idea and prevent merge conflicts:
    sched/fair: Snapshot the min_vruntime of CPUs on force idle
    sched: Improve snapshotting of min_vruntime for CGroups
  Same with the RT priority inversion change:
    sched: Fix priority inversion of cookied task with sibling
    sched: Improve snapshotting of min_vruntime for CGroups
- Disable coresched on certain AMD HW.
