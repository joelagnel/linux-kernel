Hello!
These are RFC patches for the core-scheduling interface that are only
build-tested and could be buggy, but I am just sharing early to give an idea
about the direction I was going. I will be continuing to work on it next week.
Meanwhile your feedback is very welcome!

The main usecases covered are both practical and cover ChromeOS and Google
cloud usecases:

1. ChromeOS uses a per-process prctl interface. Every tab in Chrome is
   sandboxed and cannot be trusted. A prctl interface which accepts a PID to share
   a core with is proposed. The PID idea came from Peter Zijlstra.

2. Google cloud uses CGroups with two-tag hierarchy. The first tag can be set
   only by privileged while the second is not. Please see the patch for more
   details.  For upstream, I have chosen that the first-level tag is a boolean and
   that first-level cookie value is not exposed to the user for security reasons.

These patches are based on the v7 core-scheduling series recently posted:
https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/cover.1598643276.git.jdesfossez@digitalocean.com/T/#t

For the CGroup usecase, for this first pass - I avoided handling the case where
the tag is 0 in a sub-cgroup, but its color is set and such CGroup's parent is
tagged.
