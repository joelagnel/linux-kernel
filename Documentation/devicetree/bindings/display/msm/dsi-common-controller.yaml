      # Optional Properties for dsi controller
  qcom,mdss-mdp-transfer-time-us:
    description: |
      Specifies the DSI transfer time for command mode
      panels in microseconds. Driver uses this number to adjust
      the clock rate according to the expected transfer time.
      Increasing this value would slow down the mdp processing
      and can result in slower performance.
      Decreasing this value can speed up the mdp processing,
      but this can also impact power consumption.
      As a rule this time should not be higher than the time
      that would be expected with the processing at the
      DSI link rate since anyways this would be the maximum
      transfer time that could be achieved.
      If ping pong split is enabled, this time should not be higher
      than two times the DSI link rate time.
      If the property is not specified, then the default value is
      14000 us. This is an optional property.

  qcom,dual-dsi-mode:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Boolean value indicating if the DSI controller is
      driving a panel which needs 2 DSI links.

  qcom,master-dsi:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Boolean value indicating if the DSI controller is driving
      the master link of the 2-DSI panel.

  qcom,sync-dual-dsi:
    type: boolean
    description: |
      Boolean value indicating if the DSI controller is driving a
      2-DSI panel whose 2 links need receive command simultaneously.

  ports:
    type: object
    description: |
      Contains DSI controller input and output ports as children, each
      containing one endpoint subnode as defined in
      Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt and
      Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt.

    properties:
      port@0:
        type: object
        description: |
          Input endpoints of the controller.

        properties:

            const: 0

          endpoint:
            type: object
            properties:
              remote-endpoint:
                description: |
                  For port@0, set to phandle of the connected panel/bridge's
                  input endpoint. For port@1, set to the MDP interface output.
                  See Documentation/devicetree/bindings/graph.txt for
                  device graph info.

              data-lanes:
                description: |
                  This describes how the physical DSI data lanes are mapped
                  to the logical lanes on the given platform. The value contained in
                  index n describes what physical lane is mapped to the logical lane n
                  (DATAn, where n lies between 0 and 3). The clock lane position is fixed
                  and can't be changed. Hence, they aren't a part of the DT bindings. See
                  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/media/video-interfaces.txt for
                  more info on the data-lanes property.

                  For example:
                  data-lanes = <3 0 1 2>;

                  The above mapping describes that the logical data lane DATA0 is mapped
                  to the physical data lane DATA3, logical DATA1 to physical DATA0,
                  logic DATA2 to phys DATA1 and logic DATA3 to phys DATA2. There are
                  only a limited number of physical to logical mappings possible.
